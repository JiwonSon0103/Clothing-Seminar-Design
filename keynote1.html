                                Woo Seok Kong is currently a professor of the Department of Geography at Kyunghee University in Korea. He received his Ph.D. in Biogeography from the University of Hull in UK. He is interested in how climate change has affected the distribution and diversity of plants growing in high mountains since geological times. He is currently researching the relationship between the natural environment, such as the current climate, topography, and soil, and humans and ecosystems in the field. He does not stop at researching and teaching natural ecosystems and environmental problems, but tries to solve them by putting them into practice in everyday life. He has authored 『Climate change and ecosystems 41 keywords』, 『Biogeography of Korean Plants』, 『Vegetation History of the Korean Peninsula 』, 『Natural Ecosystem of North Korea』, 『Conifer Science I』, 『Why Climate Change Is it a Problem?”, “Climate Crisis”, “Walking in the Needle Leaf Forest”, “People who live in symbiosis with the Earth”, and “ Résumé of trees and forests of Korea .
